    "Once upon a time, in the year 2021, a group of analysts were presented with a challenging task: to perform an analysis of the sales of drugs sold in the United States. They were given a dataset called DrugUtilization2021.csv, which contained valuable information about drug sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysts knew that this was going to be a difficult task, but they were determined to take it on. They started by examining the data and familiarizing themselves with the different variables. They realized that the dataset contained information about the type of drug, its dosage, the number of prescriptions, and the total cost of the drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the data, the analysts set out to answer a series of questions that would help them gain insights into the drug sales in the United States. They wanted to know which drugs were the most commonly prescribed, which drugs had the highest cost, and which drugs had the most significant increase or decrease in sales over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysts spent hours poring over the data, examining trends and patterns. They found that the most commonly prescribed drugs were statins, which are used to lower cholesterol levels, and levothyroxine, which is used to treat hypothyroidism. They also discovered that the drug with the highest cost was adalimumab, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the analysts found that the sales of some drugs had increased significantly over time, while others had decreased. For example, the sales of hydroxychloroquine, which was once used to treat COVID-19, had seen a massive increase, while the sales of opioids had decreased due to the opioid epidemic in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data and answering the questions, the analysts were able to gain valuable insights into the sales of drugs in the United States. They realized that drug sales are influenced by a variety of factors, including the prevalence of certain diseases, changes in prescribing patterns, and public health crises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the analysts found the analysis of drug sales to be a challenging but rewarding task. They were able to gain valuable insights into the pharmaceutical industry and the factors that influence the sales of drugs in the United States.\n",

The MCOU Record ID indicates that the information for this NDC represents a Managed Care Organization (MCO) Utilization record. Valid Values: 4Q2009 and earlier = Constant record ID of FFSU.1Q2010 and beyond = FFSU & MCOU. NOTE: Per the Affordable Care Act, MCO utilization data cannot be reported for periods prior to 1Q2010. (Formerly known as \"Record ID.\") |\n",

    "| Suppression Used | The state drug utilization data includes state, drug name, NDC, number of prescriptions, and dollars reimbursed. As CMS is obligated by the Federal Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 C.F.R Parts 160 and 164, to protect the privacy of individual beneficiaries and other persons, all direct identifiers have been removed and data that are less than eleven (11) counts are suppressed. A checkmark in the \"Suppression Used\" column notes suppressed data. CMS applies counter or secondary suppression in cases where only one prescription is suppressed for primary reasons (e.g., one prescription in a state). Also, if one sub-group (e.g., number of prescriptions) is suppressed, then the other sub-groups are suppressed. |\n",
    "|Units Reimbursed |  FFS Units - The number of units (based on Unit Type) of the drug 11-digit NDC reimbursed by the state during the quarter/year covered. MCO Units - The number of units (based on Unit Type) of the 11-digit NDC dispensed during the quarter/year covered. |\n",

MCO - The number of prescriptions dispensed as outpatient drug claims during the quarter/year covered. | \n",

This total is not reduced or affected by Medicaid rebates paid to the state. This amount represents both federal and state reimbursement and is inclusive of dispensing fees. Note: As capitated payment arrangements are sometimes utilized by states and MCOs, a zero value in this field could be appropriate for MCO data; however, FFS utilization records will reject if this field is reported with a value of zero.| \n",

The Non-Medicaid Amount Reimbursed includes any drug reimbursement amount for which the state is not eligible for federal matching funds. |\n",

    ">In accordance with federal laws, State Drug Utilization Data (SDUD) that has been suppressed is not available for public consumption.  As CMS is obligated by the Federal Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 C.F.R Parts 160 and 164, to protect the privacy of individual beneficiaries and other persons, all direct identifiers have been removed and data that are less than eleven (11) counts are suppressed. A checkmark in the \"Suppression Used\" column notes suppressed data. CMS applies counter or secondary suppression in cases where only one prescription is suppressed for primary reasons, (e.g., one prescription in a state). Also, if one sub-group (e.g., number of prescriptions) is suppressed, then the other sub-group is suppressed.\n",
